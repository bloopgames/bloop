## Why Bloop?

Game engines like Godot and Unity are primarily *rendering* engines -  simulation is tightly coupled to rendering and can only step forward, making it increasingly difficult to iterate as the game grows.

Imagine a movie editing software that only allowed you to play the movie forward without being able to rewind or jump to a moment in time.

This would obviously make film editing much shittier and lead to frustration and crunch, and yet it's the cutting edge of game development today.

Meanwhile, people working on the web enjoy the benefits of hot reloading, declarative rendering and time-travel debugging.

I believe that 2d indie game development can be radically improved by applying this method of developing software to writing game logic.
